###### Internet Mail System

* The Internet mail system has three major components: user agents, mail servers, and the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).
* User agents (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, etc) allow users to read, reply to, forward, save, and compose messages.
* Journey of mail: Sender's user agent -> Sender's mail server (outgoing queue) -> Recipient's mail server (mailbox) -> Recipient's user agent
* When the recipient wants to access the messages in their mailbox, their mail server authenticates the recipient and then their user agent retrieves the mails from the mailbox.
* The sender's mail server also deals with failures in reciever's mail server, in which case the mail remains in the message queue of the sender and re-attempts delivery. 
* SMTP is the principal application-layer protocol for Internet electronic mail.
	* It uses the reliable data transfer service of TCP to transfer mail from the sender’s mail server to the recipient’s mail server.
 	* As with most application-layer protocols, SMTP has two sides: a client side, which executes on the sender’s mail server, and a server side, which executes on the recipient’s mail server.
  	* Both the client and server sides of SMTP run on every mail server.
  	* When a mail server sends mail to other mail servers, it acts as an SMTP client.
  	* When a mail server receives mail from other mail servers, it acts as an SMTP server.

### 1. SMTP

* SMTP transfers messages from senders’ mail servers to the recipients’ mail servers.
* Following illustrates the basic operation of SMTP (Alice is sending a mail to Bob):
	* Alice invokes her user agent for e-mail, provides Bob’s e-mail address, composes a message, and instructs the user agent to send the message.
 	* Alice’s user agent sends the message to her mail server, where it is placed in a message queue.
  	* The client side of SMTP, running on Alice’s mail server, sees the message in the message queue, and opens a TCP connection to an SMTP server running on Bob’s mail server.
  	* If the receiever's mail server is down, the client server tries again later.
  	* After some initial SMTP handshaking (in which the client indiactes the email address of the sender and recipient), the SMTP client sends Alice’s message into the TCP connection.
  	* At Bob’s mail server, the server side of SMTP receives the message.
  	* Bob’s mail server then places the message in Bob’s mailbox.
  	* Bob invokes his user agent to read the message at his convenience.
* SMTP does not normally use intermediate mail servers for sending mail, even if the two mail server are at the opposite ends of the world.
* SMTP uses persistent connections: If the sending mail server has several messages to send to the same receiving mail server, it can send all of the messages over the same TCP connection.

###### Transcript between SMTP mail servers

* In the following transcript, there are SMTP client (C) and an SMTP server (S).
* The hostname of the client is `crepes.fr` and the hostname of the server is `hamburger.edu`.

```
S: 220 hamburger.edu
C: HELO crepes.fr
S: 250 Hello crepes.fr, pleased to meet you
C: MAIL FROM: <alice@crepes.fr>
S: 250 alice@crepes.fr ... Sender ok
C: RCPT TO: <bob@hamburger.edu>
S: 250 bob@hamburger.edu ... Recipient ok
C: DATA
S: 354 Enter mail, end with ”.” on a line by itself
C: From: Alice <alice@crepes.fr>
C: To: Bob <bob@hamburger.edu>
C: Subject: Test Email
C: 
C: Hello
C: How are you?
C: .
S: 250 Message accepted for delivery
C: QUIT
S: 221 hamburger.edu closing connection
```

### 2. Mail Message Formats

* When an e-mail message is sent from one person to another, a header containing peripheral information precedes the body of the message itself.
* The header lines and the body of the message are separated by a blank line (that is, by CRLF).
* Every header must have a `From:` header line and a `To:` header line, and may include a `Subject:` header line, along with other optional header lines.
* It is important to note that these header lines are different from the SMTP commands (even though they contain some common words such as “from” and “to”).
* The SMTP commands were part of the SMTP handshaking protocol, while the header lines are part of the mail message itself.
* They message header in the above transcript is the following block:
```
From: alice@crepes.fr
To: bob@hamburger.edu
Subject: Test Email
```

### 3. Mail Access Protocols

* The diagram below highlights the three-step process that a mail goes through. Note that:
	* The recipient's user agent is in their local device but their mail server is not.
 		* If the recipient's mail server were to be on the recipient's local host, then that host would have to remain always on and connected to the Internet, as a new mail can arrive at any time.
   		* This is impractical for many Internet users, and hence, a typical user runs a user agent on the local host but accesses their mailbox stored on an always-on shared mail server. 
	* The sender's user agent doesn't directly communicate with the recipient's mail server.
 		* This is primaily because without relaying through sender's mail server, the sender's user agent would not have any recourse to an unreachable destination mail server.
server becomes operational
   		* By having the sender user agent first deposit the e-mail in its own mail server, the sender's mail server can repeatedly try to send the message to the recipient's mail server.
 	* As SMTP is a push protocol, the recipient cannot pull the mail from their mail box (present in their mail server) using SMTP.
  		* There are two common ways for the recipeint to retrieve their e-mail from a mail server - HTTP and IMAP.
		* If the recipeint is using Web-based e-mail or a smartphone app (such as Gmail), then the user agent will use HTTP to retrieve the e-mail. This case requires the recipient mail server to have an HTTP interface as well as an SMTP interface.
  		* The alternative method, typically used with mail clients such as Microsoft Outlook, is to use the Internet Mail Access Protocol (IMAP) defined.
    	* Both the HTTP and IMAP approaches allow the recipient to manage folders, maintained in the recipient's mail server.
