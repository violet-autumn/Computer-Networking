###### Network Applications
* At the core of network application development is writing programs that run on different end systems and communicate with each other over the network.
* For example, in the Web application there are two distinct programs that communicate with each other:
	* The browser program running in the user’s host (desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone, etc)
 	* The Web server program running in the Web server host.
* Thus, when developing a new application, we need to write software that will run on multiple end systems.
* Importantly, we do not need to write software that runs on network-core devices, such as routers or link-layer switches (they cannot run application layer).
* This design of confining application software to the end systems has facilitated the rapid development and deployment of a vast array of network applications.

### 1. Network Application Architectures

* The application architecture is different from the network architecture (the five-layered Internet architecture).
* The application architecture is designed by the application developer and dictates how the application is structured over the various end systems. They predominantly follow:
	* The client-server architecture, or
 	* The peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture.

###### Client Server Architecture
* In a client-server architecture, there is an always-on host, called the server, which services requests from many other hosts, called clients.
* A classic example is the Web application for which an always-on Web server services requests from browsers running on client hosts.
* Another example of this architecture are FTP, Telnet, e-mail.
* In this architecture, the clients do not directly communicate with each other, and the server has a fixed well-known name/IP address.
* Often in a client-server application, a single-server host is incapable of keeping up with all the requests from clients.
* Hence, a data center housing a large number of hosts is often used to create a powerful virtual server.

###### Peer-to-Peer Architecture
* In a P2P architecture, there is minimal (or no) reliance on dedicated servers in data centers.
* Instead the application uses direct communication between pairs of intermittently connected hosts, called peers.
* The peers are not owned by the service provider, but are instead desktops and laptops controlled by users.
* An example of a popular P2P application is the file-sharing application BitTorrent.
* One of the most compelling features of P2P architectures is their self-scalability (each host adds capacity to the network) and cost effictiveness (these applications normally don’t require significant server infrastructure and server bandwidth).
* However, P2P applications face challenges of security, performance, and reliability due to their highly decentralized structure.

### 2. Processes Communicating

###### Processes
* A process can be thought of as a program that is running within an end system.
* When processes are running on the same end system, they can communicate with each other with interprocess communication, using rules that are governed by
the end system’s operating system.
* Processes on two different end systems communicate with each other by exchanging messages across the computer network.
	* A sending process creates and sends messages into the network
 	* A receiving process receives these messages and possibly responds by sending messages back.
  	* Processes communicating with each other reside in the application layer of the five-layer protocol stack.

###### Client and Server Processes
* A network application consists of pairs of processes that send messages to each other over a network.
	* In the Web application a client browser process exchanges messages with a Web server process.
 	* In a P2P file-sharing system, a file is transferred from a process in one peer to a process in another peer.
* For each pair of communicating processes, we label one of the two processes as the client and the other process as the server.
	* With the Web, a browser is a client process and a Web server is a server process.
 	* With P2P file sharing, the peer that is downloading the file is labeled as the client, and the peer that is uploading the file is labeled as
the server.
* Therefore, client and server processes camn be defined as - In the context of a communication session between a pair of processes, the process that initiates the communication is labeled as the client. The process that waits to be contacted to begin the session is the server.

###### Sockets - The Interface Between the Process and the Computer Network
* A process sends messages into, and receives messages from, the network through a software interface called a socket.
* A socket is the interface between the application layer and the transport layer within a host.
	* It is also referred to as the Application Programming Interface (API) between the application and the network, since the socket is the programming interface with which network applications are built.
 	* The application developer has control of everything on the application-layer side of the socket but has little control of the transport-layer side
of the socket.
	* The only control that the application developer has on the transport layer side is the choice of transport protocol (TCP/UDP) and the ability to fix a few transport-layer parameters such as maximum buffer and maximum segment sizes.
* Once the application developer chooses a transport protocol, the application is built using the transport-layer services provided by that protocol.

###### Addressing Processes using Ports
* Once a message reaches the recieving host via its IP address, it needs to identify the receiving process (as the host can have multiple networking applications running simultaneously).
* For this, an identifier called the destination port is used to specify the receiving process in the destination host.
* Popular applications have been assigned specific port numbers. For example,
	* For example, a Web server is identified by port number 80.
 	* A mail server process (using the SMTP protocol) is identified by port number 25.
  	* FTP uses port 21 for the control connection and port 20 for the data connection.

### 3. Transport Services Available to Applications

* Many networks, including the Internet, provide multiple transport-layer protocols.
* When an application is developed, we need to choose one of the available transport-layer protocols.
* This choice is influenced by the services provided by different protocols, which can broadly be classified along the following four dimensions:
	* Reliable data transfer
 	* Throughput
  	* Timing
  	* Security

###### Reliable data transfer
* Packet loss can happen in the computer network, due to a buffer overflow in a router or corruption in its bits during transmission.
* One important service that a transport-layer protocol can potentially provide to an application is process-to-process reliable data transfer.
* When a transport protocol provides this service, the sending process can just pass its data into the socket and know with complete confidence that the data will arrive without errors at the receiving process.
* For many applications—such as electronic mail, file transfer, remote host access, web document transfers, and financial applications—data loss can have devastating consequences, and hence they need reliable data transfer.
* When a transport-layer protocol doesn’t provide reliable data transfer, some of the data sent by the sending process may never arrive at the receiving process.
* This may be acceptable for loss-tolerant applications, such as multimedia applications like conversational audio/video that can tolerate some amount of data loss.

###### Throughput
* The throughput between two processes along a network path is the rate at which the sending process can deliver bits to the receiving process.
* As other sessions will be sharing the bandwidth along the network path, the available throughput can fluctuate with time.
* Hence, another natural service that a transport-layer protocol could provide is guaranteed available throughput at some specified rate.
* With such a service, the application could request a guaranteed throughput of r bits/sec, and the transport protocol would then ensure that the available throughput is always at least r bits/sec.
* This would be a useful service for say an Internet telephony application that needs to send data into the network and have data delivered to the receiving application at a given minimum rate.
* Applications that have throughput requirements are called bandwidth-sensitive applications.
* For example, many multimedia and video conferencing applications are bandwidth-sensitive.
* On the other hand, elastic applications can make use of as much, or as little, throughput as happens to be available.
* For example, Electronic mail, file transfer, and Web transfers are all elastic applications.

###### Timing
* A transport-layer protocol can also provide timing guarantees.
* As with throughput guarantees, timing guarantees can come in many shapes and forms.
* For example, a guarantee might be that every bit that the sender pumps into the socket arrives at the receiver’s socket no more than 100 msec later.
* Such a service would be useful for interactive real-time applications, such as Internet telephony, virtual environments, teleconferencing, and multiplayer games, all of which require tight timing constraints on data delivery in order to be effective.
* For non-real-time applications, lower delay is always preferable to higher delay, but no tight constraint is placed on the end-to-end delays.

###### Security
* A transport protocol can provide an application with one or more security services.
* For example, in the sending host, a transport protocol can encrypt all data transmitted by the sending process, and in the receiving host, the transport-layer protocol can decrypt the data before delivering the data to the receiving process.
* Such a service would provide confidentiality between the two processes, even if the data is somehow observed between sending and receiving processes.
* A transport protocol can also provide other security services in addition to confidentiality, including data integrity and end-point authentication.

### 4. Transport Services Provided by the Internet

* The Internet (and, more generally, TCP/IP networks) makes two transport protocols available to applications: TCP and UDP.

###### TCP Services
* The TCP service model includes the following services: 
* Connection-oriented service
	* TCP has the client and server exchange transport layer control information with each other before the application-level messages begin to flow.
 	* This so-called handshaking procedure alerts the client and server, allowing them to prepare for an onslaught of packets.
  	* After the handshaking phase, a TCP connection is said to exist between the sockets of the two processes.
  	* The connection is a full-duplex connection in that the two processes can send messages to each other over the connection at the same time.
* Reliable data transfer service
	* The communicating processes can rely on TCP to deliver all data sent without error and in the proper order.
 	* When one side of the application passes a stream of bytes into a socket, it can count on TCP to deliver the same stream of bytes to the receiving socket, with no missing or duplicate bytes.
* Congestion control service
	* TCP also includes a congestion-control mechanism, a service for the general welfare of the Internet rather than for the direct benefit of the communicating processes.
 	* The TCP congestion-control mechanism throttles a sending process (client or server) when the network is congested between sender and receiver.
* Transport Layer Security (TLS)
	* The TCP by defualt does not provide security services.
 	* Owing to privacy and security issues, the Internet community developed an enhancement for TCP called Transport Layer Security (TLS).
  	* TCP-enhanced-with-TLS does everything that traditional TCP does but also provides critical process-to-process security services, including encryption, data integrity, and end-point authentication.
  	* TLS is not a third Internet transport protocol but instead is an enhancement of TCP, with the enhancements being implemented in the application layer.
  		* In particular, if an application wants to use the services of TLS, it needs to include TLS code in both the client and server sides of the application.
  	 	* TLS has its own socket API that is similar to the traditional TCP socket API.
  	  	* When an application uses TLS, the sending process passes cleartext data to the TLS socket; TLS in the sending host then encrypts the data and passes the encrypted data to the TCP socket.
  	  	* The encrypted data travels over the Internet to the TCP socket in the receiving process.
  	  	* The receiving socket passes the encrypted data to TLS, which decrypts the data, and finally, TLS passes the cleartext data through its TLS socket to the receiving process.

###### UDP Services
* UDP is a no-frills, lightweight transport protocol, providing minimal services.
* UDP is connectionless, so there is no handshaking before the two processes start to communicate.
* UDP provides an unreliable data transfer service—that is, when a process sends a message into a UDP socket, UDP provides no guarantee that the message will ever reach the receiving process.
* Furthermore, messages that do arrive at the receiving process may arrive out of order.
* UDP does not include a congestion-control mechanism, so the sending side of UDP can pump data into the layer below (the network layer) at any rate it pleases.

###### Services Not Provided by Internet Transport Protocols
* TCP provides reliable end-to-end data transfer, and can be easily enhanced at the application layer with TLS to provide security services.
* However, neither TCP not UDP provide throughput or timing guarantees.
* Nonetheless, the Internet has been hosting time-sensitive applications, and they often work fairly well because they have been designed to cope, to the greatest extent possible, with this lack of guarantee.
* However, clever design has its limitations when delay is excessive, or the end-to-end throughput is limited, in which cases these applications run into problems.
* In summary, today’s Internet can often provide satisfactory service to time sensitive applications, but it cannot provide any timing or throughput guarantees.

***

### 5. Application-Layer Protocols

* An application-layer protocol defines how an application’s processes, running on different end systems, pass messages to each other.
* In particular, an application-layer protocol defines:
	* The types of messages exchanged, for example, request messages and response messages
 	* The syntax of the various message types, such as the fields in the message and how the fields are delineated
  	* The semantics of the fields, that is, the meaning of the information in the fields
  	* Rules for determining when and how a process sends messages and responds to messages
* Some application-layer protocols are specified in RFCs and are therefore in the public domain.
	* HTTP is an example of such a protocol.
 	* If a browser developer follows the rules of the HTTP RFC, the browser will be able to retrieve Web pages from any Web server that has also followed the rules of the HTTP RFC.
* However, many other application-layer protocols are proprietary and intentionally not available in the public domain.
	* Skype is an application that uses proprietary application-layer protocols.
* It's important to remember that an application-layer protocol is only one piece of a network application.
	* For example, The Web is a client-server application that allows users to obtain documents from Web servers on demand.
 	* The Web application consists of HTML, Web browsers, Web servers, and an application-layer protocol (HTTP).
	* HTTP defines the format and sequence of messages exchanged between browser and Web server.
