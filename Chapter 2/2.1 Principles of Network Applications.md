###### Network Applications
* At the core of network application development is writing programs that run on different end systems and communicate with each other over the network.
* For example, in the Web application there are two distinct programs that communicate with each other:
	* The browser program running in the user’s host (desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone, etc)
 	* The Web server program running in the Web server host.
* Thus, when developing a new application, we need to write software that will run on multiple end systems.
* Importantly, we do not need to write software that runs on network-core devices, such as routers or link-layer switches (they cannot run application layer).
* This design of confining application software to the end systems has facilitated the rapid development and deployment of a vast array of network applications.

### 1. Network Application Architectures

* The application architecture is different from the network architecture (the five-layered Internet architecture).
* The application architecture is designed by the application developer and dictates how the application is structured over the various end systems. They predominantly follow:
	* The client-server architecture, or
 	* The peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture.

###### Client Server Architecture
* In a client-server architecture, there is an always-on host, called the server, which services requests from many other hosts, called clients.
* A classic example is the Web application for which an always-on Web server services requests from browsers running on client hosts.
* Another example of this architecture are FTP, Telnet, e-mail.
* In this architecture, the clients do not directly communicate with each other, and the server has a fixed well-known name/IP address.
* Often in a client-server application, a single-server host is incapable of keeping up with all the requests from clients.
* Hence, a data center housing a large number of hosts is often used to create a powerful virtual server.

###### Peer-to-Peer Architecture
* In a P2P architecture, there is minimal (or no) reliance on dedicated servers in data centers.
* Instead the application uses direct communication between pairs of intermittently connected hosts, called peers.
* The peers are not owned by the service provider, but are instead desktops and laptops controlled by users.
* An example of a popular P2P application is the file-sharing application BitTorrent.
* One of the most compelling features of P2P architectures is their self-scalability (each host adds capacity to the network) and cost effictiveness (these applications normally don’t require significant server infrastructure and server bandwidth).
* However, P2P applications face challenges of security, performance, and reliability due to their highly decentralized structure.

### 2. Processes Communicating

###### Processes
* A process can be thought of as a program that is running within an end system.
* When processes are running on the same end system, they can communicate with each other with interprocess communication, using rules that are governed by
the end system’s operating system.
* Processes on two different end systems communicate with each other by exchanging messages across the computer network.
	* A sending process creates and sends messages into the network
 	* A receiving process receives these messages and possibly responds by sending messages back.
  	* Processes communicating with each other reside in the application layer of the five-layer protocol stack.

###### Client and Server Processes
* A network application consists of pairs of processes that send messages to each other over a network.
	* In the Web application a client browser process exchanges messages with a Web server process.
 	* In a P2P file-sharing system, a file is transferred from a process in one peer to a process in another peer.
* For each pair of communicating processes, we label one of the two processes as the client and the other process as the server.
	* With the Web, a browser is a client process and a Web server is a server process.
 	* With P2P file sharing, the peer that is downloading the file is labeled as the client, and the peer that is uploading the file is labeled as
the server.
* Therefore, client and server processes camn be defined as - In the context of a communication session between a pair of processes, the process that initiates the communication is labeled as the client. The process that waits to be contacted to begin the session is the server.

###### Sockets - The Interface Between the Process and the Computer Network
* A process sends messages into, and receives messages from, the network through a software interface called a socket.
* A socket is the interface between the application layer and the transport layer within a host.
	* It is also referred to as the Application Programming Interface (API) between the application and the network, since the socket is the programming interface with which network applications are built.
 	* The application developer has control of everything on the application-layer side of the socket but has little control of the transport-layer side
of the socket.
	* The only control that the application developer has on the transport layer side is the choice of transport protocol (TCP/UDP) and the ability to fix a few transport-layer parameters such as maximum buffer and maximum segment sizes.
* Once the application developer chooses a transport protocol, the application is built using the transport-layer services provided by that protocol.

###### Addressing Processes using Ports
* Once a message reaches the recieving host via its IP address, it needs to identify the receiving process (as the host can have multiple networking applications running simultaneously).
* For this, an identifier called the destination port is used to specify the receiving process in the destination host.
* Popular applications have been assigned specific port numbers. For example,
	* For example, a Web server is identified by port number 80.
 	* A mail server process (using the SMTP protocol) is identified by port number 25.
  	* FTP uses port 21 for the control connection and port 20 for the data connection.
