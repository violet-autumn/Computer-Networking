###### Hostnames and IP addresses
* One identifier for an Internet host is its hostname, such as www.google.com, gaia.cs.umass.edu, www.wikipedia.org etc.
* Hostnames are mnemonic and are therefore appreciated by humans.
* However, hostnames provide little to no information about the location within the Internet of the host.
* Further, as hostnames can consist of variable-length alphanumeric characters, they would be difficult to process by routers.
* Hence, hosts are also identified by IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6 addresses).
	* An IPv4 address consists of four bytes and has a rigid hierarchical structure.
 	* An IPv4 address looks like 121.7.106.83, where each period separates one of the bytes expressed in decimal notation from 0 to 255.
  	* An IP address is hierarchical because as we scan the address from left to right, we obtain more and more specific information about where the host is located in the Internet (that is, within which network, in the network of networks).

### 1. Services Provided by DNS

* The main task of the Internet’s domain name system (DNS) is to reconcile between humans-preferred hostnames and routers-preferred IP addresses.
* The DNS is:
	* A distributed database implemented in a hierarchy of DNS servers,
 	* An application-layer protocol that allows hosts to query the distributed database. 
* The DNS servers are often UNIX machines running the Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) software.
* The DNS protocol usaully runs over UDP (and sometimes over TCP), and uses port 53.

###### Translating Hostnames to IP address
* DNS is commonly employed by other application-layer protocols, including HTTP and SMTP, to translate user-supplied hostnames to IP addresses.
* Following example illustrates the process of an HTML application calling DNS for IP resolution:
	* The browser (that is, an HTTP client), running on some user’s host, requests the URL.
 	* The same user machine runs the client side of the DNS application.
  	* The browser extracts the hostname from the URL and passes the hostname to the client side of the DNS application.
  	* The DNS client sends a query containing the hostname to a DNS server.
  	* The DNS client eventually receives a reply, which includes the IP address for the hostname.
  	* Once the browser receives the IP address from DNS, it can initiate a TCP connection to the HTTP/HTTPS server process located at port 80/443 at that IP address.
* Refer to [DNS - IP Lookup](https://github.com/violet-autumn/Computer-Networking/blob/main/Chapter%202/Additional%20texts.md#dns---ip-address-lookup) for a small exercise on DNS resolution.
* As we can see from the above example, DNS adds an additional delay to the Internet applications that use it.
* Fortunately, the desired IP address is often cached in a “nearby” DNS server, which helps to reduce DNS network traffic as well as the average DNS delay.

###### Host aliasing
* A host with a complicated hostname can have one or more alias names.
* For example, a hostname such as `relay1.west-coast.enterprise.com` could have, say, two aliases such as `enterprise.com` and `www.enterprise.com`.
* In this case, the hostname `relay1.west-coast.enterprise.com` is said to be a canonical hostname.
* Alias hostnames, when present, are typically more mnemonic than canonical hostnames.
* DNS can be invoked by an application to obtain the canonical hostname for a supplied alias hostname as well as the IP address of the host.

###### Mail server aliasing
* DNS can be invoked by a mail application to obtain the canonical hostname for a supplied alias hostname as well as the IP address of the host.
* In fact, the MX record permits a company’s mail server and Web server to have identical (aliased) hostnames; for example, a company’s Web server and mail server can both be called `enterprise.com`.

###### Load distribution
* DNS is also used to perform load distribution among replicated servers.
* Busy sites are often replicated over multiple servers, with each server running on a different end system and each having a different IP address.
* For replicated Web servers, a set of IP addresses is thus associated with one alias hostname.
* The DNS database contains this set of IP addresses.
* When clients make a DNS query for a name mapped to a set of addresses, the server responds with the entire set of IP addresses, but rotates the ordering of the addresses within each reply.
* As a client typically sends its HTTP request message to the IP address that is listed first in the set, DNS rotation distributes the traffic among the replicated servers.
* DNS rotation is also used for e-mail so that multiple mail servers can have the same alias name.
* Content distribution companies such as Akamai have used DNS in more sophisticated ways to provide Web content distribution.

### 2. Overview of How DNS Works

###### Drawbacks of a centralised DNS design
* In a centralized design, clients simply direct all queries to the single DNS server, and the DNS server responds directly to the querying clients.
* The problems with a centralized design include:
	* A single point of failure - If the DNS server crashes, so does the entire Internet!
 	* Traffic volume - A single DNS server would have to handle all DNS queries (for all the HTTP requests and e-mail messages).
  	* Distant centralized database - A single DNS server cannot be “close to” all the querying clients and will lead to significant delays for most clients.
  	* Maintenance - The single DNS server would have to keep records for all Internet hosts. Not only would this centralized database be huge, but it would have to be updated frequently to account for every new host.
* Therefore, a centralized database in a single DNS server doesn’t scale.
* Consequently, the DNS is distributed by design.

###### A Distributed, Hierarchical Database
* DNS uses a large number of servers, organized in a hierarchical fashion and distributed around the world.
* Consequently, no single DNS server has all of the mappings for all of the hosts in the Internet.
* There are three classes of DNS servers — Root DNS servers, Top-level domain (TLD) DNS servers, and Authoritative DNS servers—organized.
* Suppose a DNS client wants to determine the IP address for the hostname `www.amazon.com`
	* The client first contacts one of the root servers, which returns IP addresses for TLD servers for the top-level domain `com`.
 	* The client then contacts one of these TLD servers, which returns the IP address of an authoritative server for `amazon.com`.
  	* Finally, the client contacts one of the authoritative servers for `amazon.com`, which returns the IP address for the hostname `www.amazon.com`.

###### Root DNS servers
* There are more than 1000 root servers instances scattered all over the world.
* These root servers are copies of 13 different root servers, managed by 12 different organizations, and coordinated through the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority.
* The full list of root name servers, along with the organizations that manage them and their IP addresses can be found at the [linked address](https://www.iana.org/domains/root/servers).
* Root name servers provide the IP addresses of the TLD servers.

###### Top-level domain (TLD) servers
* For each of the top-level domains (top-level domains such as `com`, `org`, `net`, `edu`, and `gov` and all of the country top-level domains such as `uk`, `fr`, `ca`, `in`, and `jp`), there is TLD server (or server cluster).
* The company Verisign Global Registry Services maintains the TLD servers for the `com` top-level domain, while Educause maintains the TLD servers for the `edu` top-level domain.
* TLD servers provide the IP addresses for authoritative DNS servers.

###### Authoritative DNS servers
* Every organization with publicly accessible hosts (such as Web servers and mail servers) on the Internet must provide publicly accessible DNS records that map the names of those hosts to IP addresses.
* An organization’s authoritative DNS server houses these DNS records.
* An organization can choose to implement its own authoritative DNS server or pay to have these records stored in an authoritative DNS server of some service provider.
* Most universities and large companies implement and maintain their own primary and secondary (backup) authoritative DNS server.

###### Local DNS server (Recursive DNS resolvers)
* A local DNS server does not strictly belong to the hierarchy of servers but is nevertheless central to the DNS architecture.
* Each ISP - a residential ISP or an institutional ISP - has a local DNS server (also called a default name server).
* When a host connects to an ISP, the ISP provides the host with the IP addresses of one or more of its local DNS servers.
* Some companies also provide publically available recursive DNS resolver services like Google (`8.8.8.8`) and Cloudfare (`1.1.1.1`).
* When a host makes a DNS query, the query is sent to the local DNS server (or the recursive DNS resolver), which acts a proxy and forwards the query into the DNS server hierarchy.
* The snapshot below illustrates how the local DNS server queries the DNS hierarchy (it is recursive at the requesting host to local DNS server level, and iterative across the hierarchy).
* Note that 8 DNS messages are sent in this example in order to obtain teh mapping for a single hostname.
* Sometimes it can be 10 DNS messages as the TLD server often doesn't know the authoritative DNS server directly, but through an intermediate DNS server, which adds a couple of additional hops.
* In theory, a DNS query can be iterative or recursive.
* In practice, the queries typically follow the pattern below - recursive from the requesting host to the local DNS server, and iterative across the hierarchy.

###### DNS Caching
* DNS extensively exploits DNS caching in order to improve the delay performance and to reduce the number of DNS messages ricocheting around the Internet.
* In a query chain, when a DNS server receives a DNS reply (containing, for example, a mapping from a hostname to an IP address), it can cache the mapping in its local memory.
* If a hostname/IP address pair is cached in a DNS server and another query arrives to the DNS server for the same hostname, the DNS server can provide the desired IP address, even if it is not authoritative for the hostname.
* As hosts and mappings between hostnames and IP addresses are by no means permanent, DNS servers discard cached information after a period of time (often set to two days).
* A local DNS server can also cache the IP addresses of TLD servers, thereby allowing the local DNS server to bypass the root DNS servers in a query chain. In fact, because of caching, root servers are bypassed for all but a very small fraction of DNS queries.

### 3. DNS Records and Messages

###### DNS Recource Records
* The DNS servers that together implement the DNS distributed database store resource records (RRs), including RRs that provide hostname-to-IP address mappings.
* Each DNS reply message carries one or more resource records.
* A resource record is a four-tuple that contains the following fields: `(Name, Value, Type, TTL)`
* TTL is the time to live of the resource record, and it determines when a resource should be removed from a cache.
* Following are the Types:
	* If `Type=A`, then Name is a hostname and Value is the IPv4 address for the hostname.
 		* Eg: `(relay1.bar.foo.com, 145.37.93.126, A)`.
   	* If `Type=AAAA`, then Name is a hostname and Value is the IPv6 address for the hostname.
  		* Eg: `(relay1.bar.foo.com, 2001:db8:85a3:0:0:8a2e:370:7334, AAAA)`.
 	* If `Type=NS`, then Name is a domain and Value is the hostname of an authoritative DNS server that knows how to obtain the IP addresses for hosts in the domain.
  		* This record is used to route DNS queries further along in the query chain.
  		* Eg: `(foo.com, dns.foo.com, NS)`.
  	* If `Type=CNAME`, then Value is a canonical hostname for the alias hostname Name.
  		* Eg: `(foo.com, relay1.bar.foo.com, CNAME)`.
  	* If `Type=MX`, then Value is the canonical name of a mail server that has an alias hostname Name.
  		* Eg: `(foo.com, mail.bar.foo.com, MX)`.
* If a DNS server is authoritative for a particular hostname, then the DNS server will contain a `Type A` record for the hostname.
* If a server is not authoritative for a hostname, then the server will contain a `Type NS` record for the domain that includes the hostname, and it will also contain a `Type A` record that provides the IP address of the same DNS server (that it mentioned in the `Value` field of the Type NS record).

###### DNS Messages
* Both DNS query and reply messages have the same format (snapshot below).
* The first 12 bytes is the header section, which has a number of fields.
	* The first field is a 16-bit number that identifies the query. This identifier is copied into the reply message to a query, allowing the client to match received replies with sent queries.
 	* There are a number of flags in the flag field.
  		* A 1-bit query/reply flag indicates whether the message is a query (0) or a reply (1).
    	* A 1-bit authoritative flag is set in a reply message when a DNS server is an authoritative server for a queried name.
     	* A 1-bit recursion-desired flag is set when a client (host or DNS server) desires that the DNS server perform recursion when it doesn’t have the record.
      	* A 1-bit recursion-available field is set in a reply if the DNS server supports recursion.
	* In the header, there are also four number-of fields. These fields indicate the number of occurrences of the four types of data sections that follow the header.
* The question section contains information about the query that is being made. It includes:
	* A name field that contains the name that is being queried, and
 	* A type field that indicates the type of question being asked about the name—for example, a host address associated with a name (`Type A`) or the mail server for a name (`Type MX`).
* In a reply from a DNS server, the answer section contains the resource records for the name that was originally queried.
	* In each resource record there is the Type (for example, A, NS, CNAME, and MX), the Value, and the TTL.
 	* A reply can return multiple RRs in the answer, since a hostname can have multiple IP addresses (Eg: for replicated Web servers).
* The authority section contains records of other authoritative servers.
* The additional section contains other helpful records. For example:
	* The answer field in a reply to an MX query contains a resource record providing the canonical hostname of a mail server.
 	* The additional section contains a Type A record providing the IP address for the canonical hostname of the mail server.

###### Inserting Records into the DNS Database
* A registrar is a commercial entity that verifies the uniqueness of the domain name, enters the domain name into the DNS database, and collects a fee for its services.
* Prior to 1999, a single registrar, Network Solutions, had a monopoly on domain name registration for `com`, `net`, and `org` domains.
* But now there are many registrars, and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) accredits the various registrars. [The list is available at the link](https://www.icann.org/en/contracted-parties/accredited-registrars/list-of-accredited-registrars).
* Following is what happens when a new domain is registered at the registrar: 
	* The customer registering the domain provides the registrar with the names and IP addresses of their primary and secondary authoritative DNS servers.
 	* Suppose the names and IP addresses are `dns1.networkutopia.com`, `dns2.networkutopia.com`, `212.2.212.1`, and `212.212.212.2`.
  	* For each of these two authoritative DNS servers, the registrar would then make sure that a `Type NS` and a `Type A` record are entered into the TLD com servers. That is:
  		* `(networkutopia.com, dns1.networkutopia.com, NS)` and `(dns1.networkutopia.com, 212.212.212.1, A)`.
  	 	* `(networkutopia.com, dns2.networkutopia.com, NS)` and `(dns2.networkutopia.com, 212.212.212.2, A)`.
	* The customer will also have to make sure that the `Type A` resource record for their Web server `www.networkutopia.com` and the `Type MX` resource record for their mail server `mail.networkutopia.com` are entered into their authoritative DNS servers.
* Once all of these steps are completed, people will be able to visit the Web site and send e-mail to the employees at the company.

### 4. DNS Security

###### Attacks on DNS
* DNS is a critical component of the Internet infrastructure, with many important services—including the Web and e-mail—simply incapable of functioning without it.
* An attacker could attempt to send to each DNS root server a deluge of packets, so many that the majority of legitimate DNS queries never get answered.
* Such a large-scale DDoS attack against DNS root servers took place on October 21, 2002.
* In this attack, the attackers leveraged a botnet to send loads of ICMP ping messages to each of the 13 DNS root IP addresses.
* Fortunately, this large-scale attack caused minimal damage, having little or no impact on users’ Internet experience.
* Many of the DNS root servers were protected by packet filters, configured to always block all ICMP ping messages directed at the root servers.
* Furthermore, most local DNS servers cache the IP addresses of top-level-domain servers, allowing the query process to often bypass the DNS root servers.
* A potentially more effective DDoS attack against DNS is send a deluge of DNS queries to top-level-domain servers, for example, to top-level-domain servers that handle the `.com` domain, as it is harder to filter DNS queries directed to DNS servers and top-level-domain servers are not as easily bypassed as are root servers.
* Such an attack took place against the top-level-domain service provider Dyn on October 21, 2016.
* This DDoS attack was accomplished through a large number of DNS lookup requests from a botnet consisting of about one hundred thousand IoT devices that had been infected with Mirai malware.
* For almost a full day, Amazon, Twitter, Netflix, Github and Spotify were disturbed.
* In a man-in-the-middle attack, the attacker intercepts queries from hosts and returns bogus replies. 
* In the DNS poisoning attack, the attacker sends bogus replies to a DNS server, tricking the server into accepting bogus records into its cache.
* Either of these attacks could be used, for example, to redirect an unsuspecting Web user to the attacker’s Web site.

###### DNSSEC
* DNS Security Extections (DNSSEC) is a suite of extensions that add a layer of security to the Domain Name System (DNS) by verifying the authenticity and integrity of DNS data.
* It essentially adds cryptographic signatures to DNS records, allowing resolvers to validate the origin and prevent tampering of DNS responses.
* This helps protect against attacks like DNS spoofing, DNS cache poisoning, and man-in-the-middle attacks.
