### 1. Overview of P2P architecture
* The previous applications have thus far all employed client-server architectures with significant reliance on always-on infrastructure servers.
* With a P2P architecture, there is minimal (or no) reliance on always-on infrastructure servers.
* Instead, pairs of intermittently connected hosts, called peers, communicate directly with each other.
* The peers are not owned by a service provider, but are instead PCs, laptops, and smartpones controlled by users.
* In P2P file distribution, each peer can redistribute any portion of the file it has received to any other peers, thereby assisting the server in the distribution process.
* The most popular P2P file distribution protocol is BitTorrent.
* Another application of P2P is Distributed Hast Table (DHT).
	* A distributed hash table is a simple database, with the database records being distributed over the peers in a P2P system.
 	* DHTs have been widely implemented (e.g., in BitTorrent) and have been the subject of extensive research.

### 2. Scalability of P2P Architectures

* Suppose a server and N peers are connected to the Internet.
* Denote the following:
	* Upload rate of the server’s access link by u<sub>s</sub>
 	* Upload rate of the i<sup>th</sup> peer’s access link by u<sub>i</sub>
  	* Download rate of the i<sup>th</sup> peer’s access link by d<sub>i<sub>.
  	* The size of the file to be distributed (in bits) by F.
* The distribution time (D) is the time it takes to get a copy of the file to all N peers.
* Assume that the Internet core has abundant bandwidth, implying that all of the bottlenecks are in access networks.

###### Distribution time for the client-server architecture
* The server must transmit one copy of the file to each of the N peers. Thus, the server must transmit NF bits. Since the server’s upload rate is u<sub>s</sub>, the time to distribute the file must be at least NF/u<sub>s</sub>.
* Let d<sub>min</sub> denote the download rate of the peer with the lowest download rate. The peer with the lowest download rate cannot obtain all F bits of the file in less than F/d<sub>min</sub> seconds.
* Putting these two together, D<sub>client-server</sub> = max{NF/u<sub>s</sub>, F/d<sub>min</sub>}
* For large enough N, the D<sub>client-server</sub> = NF/u<sub>s</sub>.
* Thus, the distribution time increases linearly with the number of peers N.

###### Distribution time for the P2P architecture
* In a P2P architecture, each peer can assist the server in distributing the file, this is when a peer receives some file data, it can use its own upload capacity to redistribute the data to other peers
* At the beginning of the distribution, only the server has the file. To get this file into the community of peers, the server must send each bit of the file at least once into its access link. Thus, the minimum distribution time is at least F/u<sub>s</sub>. Note that unlike the client-server scheme, a bit sent once by the server may not have to be sent by the server again, as the peers may redistribute the bit among themselves.
* As with the client-server architecture, the peer with the lowest download rate cannot obtain all F bits of the file in less than F/d<sub>min</sub> seconds. Thus, the minimum distribution time is at least F/d<sub>min</sub>.
* Finally, the total upload capacity of the system as a whole is equal to the upload rate of the server plus the upload rates of each of the individual peers, that is, u<sub>total</sub> = u<sub>s</sub> + u<sub>1</sub> + ... + u<sub>n</sub>. Thus, the minimum distribution time is also at least NF/(u<sub>s</sub> + u<sub>1</sub> + ... + u<sub>n</sub>).
* Together, D<sub>P2P</sub> = max{F/u<sub>s</sub>, F/d<sub>min</sub>, NF/(u<sub>s</sub> + u<sub>1</sub> + ... + u<sub>n</sub>)}
* In this case, the distribution time is not linear, as every time a new peer is added, its upload capacity is also plays a role in reducing the overall load.

###### Comparing D<sub>client-server</sub> and D<sub>P2P</sub>
* Setting F/u as 1 hour (so each peer takes 1 hour to transfer the file), u<sub>s</sub> as 10u (so server upload is 10x peer upload) and d<sub>min</sub> >= u<sub>s</sub>, we get the graph in the snapshot below.
* For the client-server architecture, the distribution time increases linearly and without bound as the number of peers increases.
* However, for the P2P architecture, the minimal distribution time is not only always less than the distribution time of the client-server architecture; it is also less than one hour for any number of peers N.
* Thus, applications with the P2P architecture can be self-scaling, and this scalability is a direct consequence of peers being redistributors as
well as consumers of bits.

### 3. BitTorrent

* BitTorrent is a popular P2P protocol for file distribution.
* In BitTorrent lingo, the collection of all peers participating in the distribution of a particular file is called a torrent.
* Peers in a torrent download equal-size chunks of the file from one another.
	* When a peer first joins a torrent, it has no chunks.
	* Over time it accumulates more and more chunks.
 	* While it downloads chunks it also uploads chunks to other peers.
  	* Once a peer has acquired the entire file, it may (selfishly) leave the torrent, or (altruistically) remain in the torrent and continue to upload chunks to other peers.
  	* Also, a peer may leave the torrent at any time with only a subset of chunks, and later rejoin the torrent.

###### Overview of how BitTorrent works
* Each torrent has an infrastructure node called a tracker.
* When a peer joins a torrent, it registers itself with the tracker and periodically informs the tracker that it is still in the torrent.
* When a new peer joins the torrent, the tracker randomly selects a subset of peers from the set of participating peers, and sends the IP addresses of these peers to the new user.
	* The new user attempts to establish concurrent TCP connections with all the peers on this list, and all the peers with which the new user succeeds in establishing a TCP connection are called its “neighboring peers.”
	* As time passes, some of these peers may leave and other new peers may attempt to establish TCP connections with the user.
	* Hence, a user's neighboring peers will fluctuate over time.
* At any given time, each peer will have a subset of chunks from the file, with different peers having different subsets.
* Periodically, a user will ask each of her neighboring peers for the list of the chunks they have.
* If a user has L different neighbors, they will obtain L lists of chunks.
* The user will then issue requests for the chunks they do not currently have.
* Once the user has the list of chuncks available with the neighbors, they will have two important decisions to make.
	* Which chunks should they request first from her neighbors? 
	* To which of their neighbors should they send requested chunks?
* For the first question:
	* BitTorrent uses a technique called rarest first.
 	* The idea is to determine, from among the chunks a user does not have, the chunks that are the rarest among their neighbors and then request those rarest chunks first.
  	* In this manner, the rarest chunks get more quickly redistributed, aiming to (roughly) equalize the numbers of copies of each chunk in the torrent.
  	* However, when a peer is close to completing a download, it switches to "endgame mode."
  	* In this mode, it requests all remaining pieces from all connected peers simultaneously to expedite the final few pieces.
* For the second questions:
	* BitTorrent uses a clever trading algorithm.
 	* The basic idea is that a user gives priority to the neighbors that are currently supplying them data at the highest rate.
 	* Specifically, for each of the neighbors, the user continually measures the rate at which they receives bits and determines the four peers that are feeding them bits at the highest rate.
  	* The user then reciprocates by sending chunks to these same four peers.
  	* Every 10 seconds, the user recalculates the rates and possibly modifies the set of four peers.
  	* In BitTorrent lingo, these four peers are said to be unchoked.
  	* Importantly, every 30 seconds, the user also picks one additional neighbor at random (called optimistically unchoked) and sends it chunks.
  		* As the user is sending data to this new peer, they may become one of new peer's top four uploaders, in which case the new peer would start to send data to the user.
  	 	* If the rate at which the new peer sends data to our user is high enough, the new peer could then, in turn, become one of the user's top four uploaders.
  	  	* If the two peers are satisfied with the trading, they will put each other in their top four lists and continue trading with each other until one of the peers finds a better partner.
	* The effect is that peers capable of uploading at compatible rates tend to find each other.
 	* The random neighbor selection also allows new peers to get chunks, so that they can have something to trade.
  	* All other neighboring peers besides these five peers (four “top” peers and one probing peer) are “choked,” that is, they do not receive any chunks from our user.
  	* This incentive mechanism for trading is often referred to as tit-for-tat.
  	* If BitTorrent had been designed without tit-for-tat (or a variant), but otherwise exactly the same, BitTorrent would likely not even exist now, as the majority of the users would have been freeriders. 
* BitTorrent has a number of interesting mechanisms that are not discussed here, including pieces (mini-chunks), pipelining, random first selection, endgame mode, and anti-snubbing.
