###### Network edge
* End systems sit at the edge of the network.
* These include computers, servers, mobile devices, etc.
* End systems are also referred to as hosts because they host (that is, run) application programs.
	* Hosts are further divided into two categories: clients and servers.
	* Informally, clients tend to be desktops, laptops, smartphones.
	* While servers tend to be more powerful machines that store and distribute Web pages, stream video, relay e-mail, and so on.

### 1. Access Networks

* Access networks
	* It is the network that physically connects an end system to the first router (also known as the “edge router”) on a path from the end system to any other distant end system.
 	* They can be classified as:
  		* ISP to modem/router: DSL, Cable, FTTH, and 5G Fixed Wireless
  		* Router to end system (LAN): Ethernet and WiFi
  		* Wide-Area Wireless Access: 3G and LTE 4G and 5G


#### 1.1 ISP to modem/router: DSL, Cable, FTTH, and 5G Fixed Wireless

###### Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)
* A residence typically obtains DSL Internet access from the same local telephone company (telco) that provides its wired local phone access. Thus, when DSL is used, a customer’s telco is also its ISP.
* The residential telephone line carries both data and traditional telephone signals simultaneously, which are encoded at different frequencies:
	* A high-speed downstream channel, in the 50 kHz to 1 MHz band
	* A medium-speed upstream channel, in the 4 kHz to 50 kHz band
	* An ordinary two-way telephone channel, in the 0 to 4 kHz band
* On the customer side, a splitter separates the data and telephone signals arriving to the home and forwards the data signal to the DSL modem.
* On the telco side, in the CO (central office), the DSLAM (digital subscriber line access multiplexer) separates the data and phone signals and sends the data into the Internet.
* Hundreds or even thousands of households connect to a single DSLAM.
* In this approach, the downstream and upstream rates are different, hence the access is said to be asymmetric.
* The maximum rates are limited by
	* The distance between the home and the CO
	* The gauge of the twisted-pair line
	* The degree of electrical interference.
* DSL is designed for short distances (5-10 miles) between the home and the CO.

###### Cable Internet Access
* As DSL uses the existng telco infrastructure, Cable uses the existing cable TV infrastructure.
* Traditional coaxial cables from 500 to 5000 houses connect to a neighborhood level junction called Fiber Node.
* Fiber optics run from these nodes to the cable head.
* As both fiber and coaxial cable are employed in this system, it is often referred to as hybrid fiber coax (HFC).
* On the customer end, a cable modem is used to connect to the home PC, typically through an Ethernet port (can also connect the modem to a WiFi router).
* On the cable head side, a CMTS (cable modem termination system) serves a similar function as the DSL network’s DSLAM—turning the analog signal back into digital format.
* Cable modems divide the HFC network into two channels, a downstream and an upstream channel.
* As with DSL, access is typically asymmetric, with the downstream channel typically allocated a higher transmission rate than the upstream channel.
* An important characteristic of cable Internet access is that it is a shared broadcast medium.
	* Hence, every packet sent by the cable head end travels downstream on every link to every home and every packet sent by a home travels on the upstream channel to the head end.
	* Therefore, if several users are simultaneously downloading a video file on the downstream channel, the actual rate at which each user receives its video file will be significantly lower than the aggregate cable downstream rate. On the other hand, if there are only a few active users and they are all Web surfing, then each of the users may actually receive Web pages at the full cable downstream rate, because the users will rarely request a Web page at exactly the same time.
  * As the upstream channel is also shared, a distributed multiple access protocol is needed to coordinate transmissions and avoid collisions.

###### Fiber to the home (FTTH)
* In this too, the telco is usually the ISP,and it provides an optical fiber path from the CO directly to the home.
* It can potentially provide Internet access rates in the gigabits per second range.
* There are several competing technologies for optical distribution from the CO to the homes:
	* The simplest distribution network is called direct fiber, with one fiber leaving the CO for each home.
	* More commonly, each fiber leaving the central office is shared by many homes; getting split into individual customer-specific fibers only when the fiber gets relatively close to the homes (refer to the figure below).
		* In this method, each home has an optical network terminator (ONT), which is connected by dedicated optical fiber to a neighborhood splitter.
		* The splitter combines a number of homes onto a single, shared optical fiber, which connects to an optical line terminator (OLT) in the telco’s CO.
		* On the customer end, users connect a home router to the ONT and access the Internet.
		* On the telco end, the OLT connects to the Internet via a telco router.  	
		* There are two competing optical-distribution network architectures that perform this switching:  active optical networks (AONs) and passive optical networks (PONs).
			* AONs use active, electrically powered devices to direct the appropriate signal only to the relevant customer. 
			* PONs use optical splitters, which require no electrical power, to send the signal to each customer. In this method, each customer also receives signals intended for someone else (like in the case of cable).

###### 5G Fixed Wireless
* In this too, telco is usually the ISP.
* 5G fixed wireless promises high-speed residential access without installing costly and failure-prone cabling from the telco’s CO to the home.
* With 5G fixed wireless, using beam-forming technology, data is sent wirelessly from a provider’s base station to the a modem in the home.
* A WiFi wireless router is connected to the modem (possibly bundled together), similar to how a WiFi wireless router is connected to a cable or DSL modem.


#### 1.2 Router to end system (LAN): Ethernet and WiFi

* On corporate, university campuses, and home settings, a local area network (LAN) is used to connect an end system to the edge router.
* Ethernet are WiFi are the most prevalent LAN access technologies in corporate, university, and home networks.
* Ethernet users use twisted-pair copper wire to connect to an Ethernet switch. The Ethernet switch, or a network of such interconnected switches, is then in turn connected into the larger Internet.
* WiFi on the other hand offers a wireless LAN setting, where users transmit/receive packets to/from an access point that is connected into the network, which in turn is connected to the wired Internet. A wireless LAN user must typically be within a few tens of meters of the access point.
* Many homes combine broadband residential access (that is, cable modems, DSL, or FTTH) with these inexpensive wireless LAN technologies to create powerful home networks.


#### 1.3 Wide-Area Wireless Access: 3G and LTE 4G and 5G

* Mobile devices are being used to access Internet and message, share photos, make mobile payments, watch movies, stream music, and much more while on the run, using Wireless WAN networks.
* These devices employ the same wireless infrastructure used for cellular telephony to send/receive packets through a base station that is operated by the cellular network provider. Unlike WiFi, a user need only be within a few tens of kilometers (as opposed to a few tens of meters) of the base station.
* 3G, 4G LTE, and 5G are the generations of these WAN technologies.
