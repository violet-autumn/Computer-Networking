### 1. Layered Architecture

* The Internet has a layered architecture and each layer, combined with the layers below it, implements some functionality and provides a service.
* This layered architecture allows us to discuss well-defined, specific parts of a large and complex system one-by-one.
* This simplification itself is of considerable value.
	* By providing modularity, it makes it much easier to change the implementation of the service provided by the layer.
	* As long as the layer provides the same service to the layer above it, and uses the same services from the layer below it, the remainder of the system remains unchanged when a layer’s implementation is changed.	
	* For large and complex systems that are constantly being updated, the ability to change the implementation of a service without affecting other components of the system is another important advantage of layering.

###### Protocol Layering
* To provide structure to the design of network protocols, network designers organize protocols—and the network hardware and software that implement the protocols—in layers.
* Each protocol belongs to one of the layers and each layer provides its service by
	* Performing certain actions within that layer and
 	* By using the services of the layer directly below it.
* For example, the services provided by layer n may include reliable delivery of messages from one edge of the network to the other. This might be implemented by using an unreliable edge-to-edge message delivery service of layer n - 1, and adding layer n functionality to detect and retransmit lost messages.
* A protocol layer can be implemented in software, in hardware, or in a combination of the two.
	* Application-layer protocols are almost always implemented in software in the end systems and so are transport-layer protocols.
 	* As the physical layer and data link layers are responsible for handling communication over a specific link, they are typically implemented in a network interface card (for example, Ethernet or WiFi interface cards) associated with a given link.
  	* The network layer is often a mixed implementation of hardware and software.
* When taken together, the protocols of the various layers are called the protocol stack.
* The Internet protocol stack consists of five layers: the physical, link, network, transport, and application layers.

###### Application Layer (packet: message)
* The application layer is where network applications and their application-layer protocols reside.
* The Internet’s application layer includes many protocols, such as:
	* HTTP protocol (which provides for Web document request and transfer)
 	* SMTP (which provides for the transfer of e-mail messages)
  	* FTP (which provides for the transfer of files between two end systems)
  	* DNS (which provides for the translation of website names to their 32-bit network address)
* An application-layer protocol is distributed over multiple end systems, with the application in one end system using the protocol to exchange packets of information with the application in another end system.
* This packet of information at the application layer is called a message.

###### Transport Layer (packet: segment)
* The Internet’s transport layer transports application-layer messages between application endpoints.
* In the Internet, there are two transport protocols, TCP and UDP, either of which can transport application-layer messages.
	* TCP provides a connection-oriented service to its applications that includes
 		* Guaranteed delivery of messages to the destination,
   		* Flow control (that is, sender/receiver speed matching), and
     	* Congestion control (breaking long messages into shorter segments and throttling transmission rate when the network is congsted).
	* UDP provides a connectionless service to its applications, which is a no-frills service that provides no reliability, no flow control, and no congestion control.
* The transport-layer packet is referred to as a segment.

###### Network Layer (packet: datagram)
* Network layer packets are called datagram.
* The transport-layer protocol (TCP or UDP) in a source host passes a transport-layer segment and a destination address to the network layer.
* The Internet’s network layer then provides the service of delivering the segment to the transport layer in the destination host.
* The network layer includes the IP protocol, which defines the fields in the datagram as well as how the end systems and routers act on these fields.
* There is only one IP protocol, and all Internet components that have a network layer must run the IP protocol.
* The network layer also contains routing protocols that determine the routes that datagrams take between sources and destinations.
* The Internet has many routing protocols, and as the Internet is a network of networks, the network administrator within a given network can run any routing protocol desired.

###### Link Layer (packet: frames)
* The network layer routes a datagram through a series of routers between the source and destination.
* To move a packet from one node (host or router) to the next node in the route, the network layer relies on the services of the link layer.
* At each node, the network layer passes the datagram down to the link layer, which delivers the datagram to the next node along the route, and at this next node, the link layer passes the datagram up to the network layer.
* The services provided by the link layer depend on the specific link-layer protocol that is employed over the link.
* For example, some link-layer protocols provide reliable delivery from one node to the other. Note that this reliable delivery service is different from the reliable delivery service of TCP, which provides reliable delivery from one end system to another.
* Examples of link-layer protocols include Ethernet, WiFi, PPP, and the cable access network’s DOCSIS protocol. 
* As datagrams typically need to traverse several links to travel from source to destination, a datagram may be handled by different link-layer protocols at different links along its route.
* The link layer packet is called a frame.

###### Physical Layer
* While the job of the link layer is to move entire frames from one node to the other, the job of the physical layer is to move the individual bits within the frame from one node to the next.
* The protocols in this layer are again link dependent and further depend on the actual transmission medium of the link.
* For example, Ethernet has many physical-layer protocols: one for twisted-pair copper wire, another for coaxial cable, another for fiber, and so on.
* In each case, a bit is moved across the link in a different way.

### 2. Encapsulation

* The above diagram shows the physical path that data takes down a sending end system’s protocol stack, up and down the protocol stacks of an intervening link-layer switch and router, and then up the protocol stack at the receiving end system.
* Both the packet switches (link-layer switches and routers) are not able to implement all the five layers of Internet.
	* Link layer switches implement layers 1 and 2 (they don't recognize IP addresses but route using layer 2 addresses like Ethernet addresses).
 	* Routers implement layers 1 through 3 (they can route using the IP protocol).
* The hosts implement all five layers - this is consistent with the view that the Internet architecture puts much of its complexity at the edges of the network.
* At each layer, a packet has two types of fields: header fields and a payload field.
	* The payload is typically a packet from the layer above (n+1) that gets encapsulated into the packet of the current layer (n).
 	* At the destination, layer n will use its header to deliver the payload correctly to layer n+1 - this process is called de-encapsulation.
  	* This encapsulation and de-encapsulation helps make a modular design where each layer can work independently from each other.
* In reality, the process of encapsulation is more complex.
	* For example, a large message may be divided into multiple transport-layer segments (which might themselves each be divided into multiple network-layer datagrams).
 	* At the receiving end, such a segment must then be reconstructed from its constituent datagrams.
