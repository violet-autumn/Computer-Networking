### 1. Overview of Delay in Packet-Switched networks

#### 1.1 Types of Delay

* As a packet from one host to another via a series of routers, it suffers certian delays at every node (nodal delay):
	* Processing delay 
 	* Queuing delay
  	* Transmission delay
  	* Propogation delay

###### Processing delay
* Time required to examine the packet’s header and determine where to direct the packet.
* Also includes time needed to check for bit-level errors in the packet that occurred in transmitting the packet’s bits from the upstream node.
* Processing delays in high-speed routers are typically on the order of microseconds or less.

###### Queuing delay
* After this processing, the router directs the packet to the queue that precedes the link to next node, where the packet experiences queuing delay.
* The length of the queuing delay of a specific packet will depend on the number of earlier-arriving packets that are queued and waiting for transmission onto
the link, ranging from zero wait time if the queue is empty to longer wait times if the traffic is heavy.
* Queuing delays can be on the order of microseconds to milliseconds in practice.

###### Transmission delay
* The amount of time required to push (that is, transmit) all of the packet’s bits into the link is the transmission delay.
* As seen [earlier](https://github.com/violet-autumn/Computer-Networking/blob/main/Chapter%201/1.3%20The%20Network%20Core.md#store-and-forward-packet-switching), if we denote the length of the packet by L bits, and the transmission rate of the outbound link as R bits/sec, then the transmission delay is d<sub>trans</sub>=L/R.
* Similarly, the transmission delay to send P packets across N links would be d<sub>trans</sub> = $\frac{(P+N-1) * L}{R}$.
* Transmission delays are typically on the order of microseconds to milliseconds in practice.

###### Propogation delay
* The time required to propagate from the beginning of the outbound link to next node is the propagation delay.
* The bit propagates at the propagation speed of the link, which depends on the physical medium of the link, and is in the range of 2x10<sup>^8</sup> meters/sec to 3x10<sup>^8</sup> meters/sec.
* The propagation delay can be represented by d/s, where d is the distance between two nodes and s is the propogation speed.
* In wide-area networks, propagation delays are on the order of milliseconds.
