### 1. Overview of Delay in Packet-Switched networks

#### 1.1 Types of Delay

* As a packet from one host to another via a series of routers, it suffers certian delays at every node (nodal delay):
	* Processing delay 
 	* Queuing delay
  	* Transmission delay
  	* Propogation delay

###### Processing delay
* Time required to examine the packet’s header and determine where to direct the packet.
* Also includes time needed to check for bit-level errors in the packet that occurred in transmitting the packet’s bits from the upstream node.
* Processing delays in high-speed routers are typically on the order of microseconds or less.

###### Queuing delay
* After this processing, the router directs the packet to the queue that precedes the link to next node, where the packet experiences queuing delay.
* The length of the queuing delay of a specific packet will depend on the number of earlier-arriving packets that are queued and waiting for transmission onto
the link, ranging from zero wait time if the queue is empty to longer wait times if the traffic is heavy.
* Queuing delays can be on the order of microseconds to milliseconds in practice.

###### Transmission delay
* The amount of time required to push (that is, transmit) all of the packet’s bits into the link is the transmission delay.
* As seen [earlier](https://github.com/violet-autumn/Computer-Networking/blob/main/Chapter%201/1.3%20The%20Network%20Core.md#store-and-forward-packet-switching), if we denote the length of the packet by L bits, and the transmission rate of the outbound link as R bits/sec, then the transmission delay is d<sub>trans</sub>=L/R.
* Transmission delays are typically on the order of microseconds to milliseconds in practice.

###### Propogation delay
* The time required to propagate from the beginning of the outbound link to next node is the propagation delay.
* The bit propagates at the propagation speed of the link, which depends on the physical medium of the link, and is in the range of 2x10<sup>^8</sup> meters/sec to 3x10<sup>^8</sup> meters/sec.
* The propagation delay can be represented by d/s, where d is the distance between two nodes and s is the propogation speed.
* In wide-area networks, propagation delays are on the order of milliseconds.

#### 1.2 Comparing Transmission and Propagation Delay

* The total nodal delay is given by d<sub>nodal</sub> = d<sub>proc</sub> + d<sub>queue</sub> + d<sub>trans</sub> + d<sub>prop</sub>
* The contribution of these delay components can vary significantly.
	* d<sub>prop</sub> can be negligible for a link connecting two routers on the same university campus; however, it could be hundreds of milliseconds for two routers interconnected by a geostationary satellite link, and become the dominant term in d<sub>nodal</sub>.
 	* Similarly, d<sub>trans</sub> can range from negligible to significant. Its contribution is typically negligible for transmission rates of 10 Mbps and higher (for
example, for LANs); however, it can be hundreds of milliseconds for large Internet packets sent over low-speed dial-up modem links.
	* The processing delay, d<sub>proc</sub>, is often negligible; however, it strongly influences a router’s maximum throughput - the maximum rate at which a router can forward packets.
* If transmission delay is high and propogation delay is low, it can happen that the first bits of packet reach the next node before the last bits of the packet are even transmitted.
