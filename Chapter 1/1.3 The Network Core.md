There are two fundamental approaches to moving data through a network of links and switches - packet switching and circuit switching.

***

### 1. Packet Switching

* The Internet is a packet-switched network.
* To send a message from a source end system to a destination end system, the source breaks long messages into smaller chunks of data known as packets.
* Between source and destination, each packet travels through communication links and packet switches (predominantly, routers and link-layer switches).
* Packets are transmitted over each communication link at a rate equal to the full transmission rate of the link. So, if a source end system or a packet switch is sending a packet of L bits over a link with transmission rate R bits/sec, then the time to transmit the packet is $\frac{L}{R}$ seconds.

###### Store-and-Forward Packet Switching

* Most packet switches use store-and-forward transmission.
* Store-and-forward transmission means that the packet switch must receive the entire packet before it can begin to transmit the first bit of the packet onto the outbound link.
* Ignoring delays caused by other factors, the transmission delay for sending one packet across a link using store-and-forward switching would be d<sub>trans</sub> = $\frac{L}{R}$.
* Therefore, the end-to-end transmission delay for sending one packet across N links (implying n-1 packet switches and 2 end systems) would be d<sub>trans</sub> = $\frac{NL}{R}$. 
* Finally, the end-to-end transmission delay for sending P packets across N links would be d<sub>trans</sub> = $\frac{(P+N-1) * L}{R}$.

###### Queuing Delays and Packet Loss

* Each packet switch has multiple links attached to it.
* For each attached link, the packet switch has an output buffer (also called an output queue), which stores packets that the router is about to send into that link.
* If an arriving packet needs to be transmitted onto a link but finds the link busy with the transmission of another packet, the arriving packet must wait in the output buffer.
* Thus, in addition to the store-and-forward delays, packets suffer output buffer queuing delays. These delays are variable and depend on the level of congestion in the network.
* In case the buffer is completely full when a packet arrives, packet loss will occur — either the arriving packet or one of the already-queued packets will be dropped.

###### Forwarding Tables and Routing Protocols

* Packet forwarding is done in different ways in different types of computer networks. This section describes how it works on the Intrnet.
* In the Internet, every end system has an address called an IP address.
* When a source end system wants to send a packet to a destination end system, the source includes the destination’s IP address in the packet’s header.
* This address has a hierarchical structure as it helps in easier management and faster routing of packets.
* Each router has a forwarding table that maps destination addresses (or portions of the destination addresses) to that router’s outbound links.
* When a packet arrives at a router, the router examines the IP address in the packet header and searches its forwarding table to find the appropriate outbound link.
* The Internet has a number of special routing protocols that are used to automatically set the forwarding tables (like BGP!).
* A routing protocol may, for example, determine the shortest path from each router to each destination and use the shortest path results to configure the forwarding tables in the routers.

### 2. Circuit Switching

* In circuit-switched networks, the resources needed along a path (buffers, link transmission rate) to provide for communication between the end systems are reserved for the duration of the communication session between the end systems.
* This is in contrast with packet-switched networks where these resources are not reserved and a session’s messages use the resources on demand and, as a consequence, may have to wait at times.
* Traditional telephone networks are examples of circuit-switched networks.
	* Before the sender can send the information via the call, the network must establish a connection between the sender and the receiver - called a circuit.
 	* This is a bona fide connection for which the switches on the path between the sender and receiver maintain connection state for that connection.
  	* When the network establishes the circuit, it also reserves a constant transmission rate in the network’s links (representing a fraction of each link’s transmission capacity) for the duration of the connection, allowing the sender to transfer the data to the receiver at the guaranteed constant rate.

###### Multiplexing in Circuit Switched Networks

* A circuit in a link is implemented with either: frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) or time-division multiplexing (TDM).
* FDM:
	* The frequency spectrum of a link is divided up among the connections established across the link. 
	* In telephone networks, this frequency band typically has a width of 4 kHz (that is, 4,000 hertz or 4,000 cycles per second).
 	* The width of the band is called the bandwidth.
  	* FM radio stations also use FDM to share the frequency spectrum between 88 MHz and 108 MHz, with each station being allocated a specific frequency band.
* TDM
	* In this case, time is divided into frames of fixed duration, and each frame is divided into a fixed number of time slots.
 	* When the network establishes a connection across a link, the network dedicates one time slot in every frame to this connection.
  	* These slots are dedicated for the sole use of that connection, with one time slot available for use (in every frame) to transmit the connection’s data.

###### Packet Switching Versus Circuit Switching

* Packet switching offers better sharing of transmission capacity than circuit switching, as the dedicated circuits are idle during silent periods in circuit switched networks.
* Packet switching is simpler, more efficient, and less costly to implement than circuit switching, as establishing end-to-end circuits and reserving end-to-end transmission capacity is complicated and requires complex signaling software to coordinate the operation of the switches along the end-to-end path.
* Critics of packet switching argue that packet switching is not suitable for real-time services (like telephone calls and video conference calls) because of its variable and unpredictable end-to-end delays (due primarily to variable and unpredictable queuing delays).

* Example #1 
	* Assume there is a 1Mbps link.
	* Assume each user alternates between periods of activity (generating 100kbps data) and inactivity (generating no data).
	* Assume a user is active only 10 percent of the time.
	* Capcaity for circuit switched network would be 10 (100kbps capacity of the link is reserved for each user all the time).
	* With packet switching -
		* The probability that a specific user is active is 0.1.
	 	* If there are 35 users, the probability that there are 11 or more simultaneously active users is approximately 0.0004.
	  	* When there are 10 or fewer simultaneously active users (p=0.9996), the aggregate arrival rate of data is less than or equal to 1 Mbps, and users’ packets flow through the link essentially without delay, as is the case with circuit switching.
	  	* When there are more than 10 simultaneously active users (p=0.0004), the aggregate arrival rate of packets exceeds the output capacity of the link, and the output queue will begin to grow. It continues to grow until the aggregate input rate falls back below 1 Mbps, at which point the queue will begin to diminish in length.
	  	* As the probability of having more than 10 simultaneously active users is minuscule in this example, packet switching provides essentially the same performance as circuit switching, but does so while allowing for more than three times the number of users.

* Example #2
	* Suppose there are 10 users and one user suddenly generates 1mb size of data, while other users remain quiescent and do not generate packets.
	* In circuit switching, the active user can only use the capacity of thier own circuit (100kbps) to transmit data, while the remaining nine circuits are idle - leading to transmission time of 10 seconds.
	* In packet switching, the active user can continuously send their packets at the full link rate of 1 Mbps, since there are no other users generating packets that need to be multiplexed with the active user’s packets - leading to transmission time of 1 second.
  
* Conclusion
	* Circuit switching pre-allocates use of the transmission link regardless of demand, with allocated but unneeded link time going unused.
 	* Packet switching on the other hand allocates link use on demand. Link transmission capacity will be shared on a packet-by-packet basis only among those users who have packets that need to be transmitted over the link - making it much more efficient.
